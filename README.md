# Diabetes Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains a Python project that implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not based on various health-related features. The features used for prediction include:

1. Pregnancies
2. Glucose level
3. Blood Pressure
4. Skin Thickness
5. Insulin level
6. BMI (Body Mass Index)
7. Diabetes Pedigree Function
8. Age

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify individuals into two categories: those with diabetes and those without. KNN is a simple yet effective algorithm for classification tasks that makes predictions based on the similarity of data points in the feature space.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains records of individuals, each with the above-mentioned health-related features as input and a binary target variable indicating whether the individual has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-knn.git
```

2. Install the required Python libraries, preferably in a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided to train and test the KNN model on the dataset.

## Results

The project includes an evaluation of the KNN model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can find these results in the notebook or script.
